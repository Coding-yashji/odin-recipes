            <li>Urad dal</li>

            <li>Coriander leaves</li>

        </ul>
    </p>    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>For the batter</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the urad dal in water for 6 hours. After 6 hours the urad dal will double in volume and become soft.</li>
            <li>Once done drain the water and blend the dal along with salt in a mixer, add very little water while grinding, only if required.</li>
            <li>Keep stirring the batter every few times using a spatula. Make a smooth paste.</li>
            <li>Once done remove in a large mixing bowl, and using a spatula start to whip the batter in one direction only, this will incorporate air in the batter and this will make the batter fluffy and airy.</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes of whipping the consistency of the batter will double in volume and the colour will be lighter. Almost to a whipped cream consistency.</li>
            <li>Add hing, cumin seeds and black pepper powder, green chili, coriander, curry leaves and coconut. Mix everything lightly in one direction.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>For making medu vada</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a deep frying pan, heat the oil on medium flame.</li>
            <li>Dip your hands in a bowl of clean water and then take some batter in one hand and transfer it to the other hand, to ensure we get a good shape. After that we make a hole in the centre using our wet finger.</li>
            <li>Slide the medu vada into the hot oil and deep fry them over medium flame, until they are golden brown. Follow the same procedure for the remaining vada’s. Remove on a kitchen towel.</li>
            <li>You can also make small Ulundu Vadai, by just dropping small batter dumplings in hot oil and frying them. For this step you do not have to wet your hands.</li>
            <li>Medu Vada’s are ready. Crispy from out and airy, fluffy from inside.
            </li>
        </ol>
